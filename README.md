# RaytracerChallenge
## TODO
1. [ ] Replace `MVector` with non heap-alloc'd array types. Consider
   - [ ] SVector (disadvantage: immutable, in-place modification not possible)
   - [ ] SIMD.jl vector types (`*(::SMatrix{4,4,T}, ::Vec{4, T})` needs to be implemented).
2. [ ] Create benchmarks
3. [ ] Refactor tests
4. [ ] Make README.md more presentable

## Ideas
Implement an SoA type for storing `Vec3`s and `Point`s whose interface is similar to
AoS (e.g. a regular `Vector{Vec3}`).

## Choice of data type for `Vec3` and `Point`
Heap-alloc'd data types are out of the question. While I am concerned about the immutability of SVectors,
I do not know for certain if mutating them is a common case or not. If "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" is
anything to go by, it most definitely is as we compute a running average. The alternative would be the
a much more memory-heavy allocation of an array of Vectors of and subsequent reduction.

**Note to self:** When in doubt, just measure and benchmark.
